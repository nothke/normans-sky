The source code for Normans Sky, a game I made in 10 hours for lowrezjam 2016.

[You can play the game on itch here!](https://nothke.itch.io/normans-sky)

Features a fully procedural endless universe

This repo is a "fixed" version, with a lot of 10-hour shenanigans refactored, and with the endless universe creation fixed (in the original it was actually broken).

If you want to read about how I made the game, the technical details and the aftermath of the game, [I wrote a postmortem blog post!](http://nothkedev.blogspot.com/2018/04/normans-sky-2-years-later-joke-made-in.html)
