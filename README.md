The source code for Normans Sky, a game I made in 10 hours for lowrezjam 2016.

[You can play the game on itch here!](https://nothke.itch.io/normans-sky)

* Features a fully procedural endless universe

If you want to read about how I made the game, the technical details and the aftermath of the game, [I wrote a postmortem blog post!](http://nothkedev.blogspot.com/2018/04/normans-sky-2-years-later-joke-made-in.html)

Changes to the original:
* This repo is a "fixed" version, with a lot of 10-hour shenanigans refactored
* Endless universe creation fixed (in the original it was actually broken!)
* Master branch has been updated to Unity 2019 LTS
* Spacecraft feel is slightly different due to the refactorings of Motion.cs
* Planets now have different radii
* Stars now have different colors depending on the temperature
